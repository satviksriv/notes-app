# notes-app

## Introduction:

This is a note-taking app that gives the user the options to:

**Add**: Add a particular note which contains two fields:

- Title: The note title.
- Body: The note body.

**Remove**: Remove a particular note by entering the title of the note to be removed.
**List**: List the notes.
**Read**: Read a particular note by entering the title of the note to be read.

I have used the file system and command-line arguments to make this app work.
The file system allows us to store the user's note data in JSON format (_notes.json_)
The command-line arguments allow us to get input from the user. (_Yargs module_)

## Concepts used:

1. File System and Command-line arguments. (Yargs module)
2. Storing data in JSON.
3. Arrow functions.
